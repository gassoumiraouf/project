        <p>A little over a year ago, we began to take a close interest in the idea of ​​discovering the world through the eyes of others. And if you could literally see what a protester is seeing in Ukraine? Or watch the sunrise from a hot air balloon in Cappadocia? It may sound like a crazy idea, but we wanted to get as close to teleportation as possible. While there are many other ways to discover events and places, we've found that live video is currently the best way to do it. A photo is worth a thousand words, but the live video can literally take you somewhere, as if you were there.</p>
